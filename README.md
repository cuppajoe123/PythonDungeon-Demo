# A demo for python-dungeon
This demo can be used as an example for what games made with python-dungeon can look like. It features two paths for the player to take, with a final boss at the end. My original goal was to create a text adventure in Python. Then I forked this project and made python-dungeon, which is really just the same thing but the custom assets I created for this demo were stripped away and documentation for all of the files was added. That is also the reason python-dungeon is a fork of the demo and not the other way around :) 
## Installation
python-dungeon depends on only one Python package not in the standard library. Use `pip install xlrd` to install the necessary module. It is needed for the program to parse the spreadsheet file.
